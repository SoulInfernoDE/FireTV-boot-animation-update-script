# FireTV-boot-animation-update-script (deprecated - not rooting any firetv anymore. So this is for reference of other projects here)

Makes it easier to update bootanimation.zip from twrp recovery in terminal.


Copy 'bar.sh' to /sdcard and execute it when you have placed your new
bootanimation.zip also on /sdcard.

You may need to make it executable first:

chmod +x bar.sh
